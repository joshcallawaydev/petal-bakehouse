Below is the README.md file for Petal Bakehouse.

# Overview

Petal Bakehouse is a local bakery business. Within the project I am demonstrating my understanding of HTML5 and CSS3. I used the framework Bootstrap to help structure the site. Roughly 70% of the site is Bootstrap. I also used CSS Grid within the project with Media Queries to further show my understanding of Front-end web development. The site allows users to interact and control eliments with a bootstrap carousel. This was to enhance the sites interactiveness and appeal. The site is designed to showcase a local small business bakery.

## UX

In effort to keep the site visually appealing and easy to use i decided on a simple 3 color, 3 page layout which would prevent any confusion and remove any friction. The goal of the site is to showcase the bakerys talent and drive orders in, so images are a key pillar in the site and so is usability. Contrasting colors and clear spacing helps the visual appeal and keeps the sites goals clear.

## Design

### Color scheme.

![3 color blocks showcasing the color scheme of the site. 1) #ffffff 2) #47624f 3) #ad6a6c](assets/testing_imagery/color_scheme.png)

### Typography

Lato is the font of choice with Helvetica and Sans-serif as fall back fonts should Lato not be imported into the site properly. Lato is a clear and legible font and according to google, one of the most popular choices in 2021. It also renders well on all viewport sizes.

I chose rem as my sizing metric. I feel this is the best fit in 2021 due to its flexabilty at different base sizes. I have also used percentages, VH or PX where i felt appropriate.

### Imagery

All imagery is imported into Gitpod and was downloaded from Pexels.com. The chosen images were designed to fit the site's niche and catch users attention. See below for individual file URLs...

## Wireframes/Site preview

The site was build mobile first.

I also done rough designs of the site at large viewport size (desktop)

# Testing

Testing was compiled throughout the project in effort to minimise bugs and styling issues.

The site works seamlessly across all viewport sizes but was built mobile first.

The image below does not represent the phone size at which the site was designed at. Just a representation that mobile first was the direction.

![An image of the site at a standard mobile size](assets/testing_imagery/phone_size_2.png) 

VS Code - at the half waypoint, and after some initial testing, I decided to make some structural changes to the site to improve the visual aesthetics and flow. In an effort to prevent any confusion, I migrated the code to VSC, made the structural changes there and then migrated it back in sections. This way I could test the changes and mitigate any styling issues that arose.

![VS Code screen shot](assets/testing_imagery/vscode.png)

In effort to improve UX/UI i regularly tested the site functionality and responsiveness. This way I could see UX/UI issues first hand and deploy changes in accordance with our principles. I also drafted in my partner to attempt to break the site's viewing experience.

I tested the site on chrome, safari and firefox and across all sizes in dev tools.

![Site rendering image at mobile size](assets/testing_imagery/phone_size_2.png) 
![Site view through firefox](assets/testing_imagery/fire_fox_testing.png)
![Site view through dev tools](assets/testing_imagery/dev_tools_testing.png)  

I ensured my tests were in line with the key goals and objectives of the site.

Images referred to for all the below testing is available with the repository folder, testing imagery.

1) First time

As a first time user, I want to understand what the site is for

- Early within index.html users are exposed to ‘what we offer’ to add additional context.

![An image of the call to action button](assets/testing_imagery/call_to_action.png) 

- Hero image w/ text to add further context and excitement.

![A view of the hero image. A cupcake](assets/testing_imagery/hero_img.png) 

As a first time user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site

- Upon entry, users are greeted with a navigation bar.

![An image of the nav bar](assets/testing_imagery/nav.png) 

- Call to action buttons available within the carousel and after ‘what we offer’.

![An image of the call to action button](assets/testing_imagery/call_to_action.png) 

As a first time user, i would like to see visuals of what is on offer from the site

- A carousel is present within index.html.

![An image of the image carousel](assets/testing_imagery/carousel_img.png) 

- A easily accessible gallery page.

![An image of the gallery page](assets/testing_imagery/gallery.png) 

2) Returning

As a returning user, I would like to be able to get to the order section in 3 clicks

- Click 1) order (scroll down to form) 2) submit.

![An image of the nav bar](assets/testing_imagery/form_one.png)
![An image of the order form](assets/testing_imagery/form_two.png)

As a returning user, i would like to see your contact information

- All contact information is within the footer and accessible from all pages.

![An image of the footer completed](assets/testing_imagery/footer.png) 


3) Frequent user
As a frequent user, I would like to see your social media links.

- All social links in footer across all pages. Users have come to expect this with established sites.

![An image of the footer completed](assets/testing_imagery/footer.png)

As a frequent user, i would like to see a display of new images in one place

- A easily updatable carousel available on home page (index.html) and a gallery is one click away from nav and also the CTA button.

![An image of the carousel](assets/testing_imagery/carousel_img.png)

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### - HTML Results - pass

![An image of the pass in W3C HTML validator](assets/testing_imagery/index.html_validator_pass.png) 

See folder for other html pass confimration images.

### - CSS Results - pass

![An image of the CSS pass in CSS validator](assets/testing_imagery/css_validator_2.png)

In testing I noticed that fixed image backgrounds do not render on some mobile phones. In a live project I would remove this with a media query but after seeking advice, and hearing that your testing and review is done on desktop and dev tools only, I decided to note it here only. See below image.

![An image of the fixed image rendering bug on iphone](assets/testing_imagery/fixed_img_bug.jpg)

Once the site was deployed i tested it in dev tools lighthouse. This showed that i had images of large sizes. I have compressed the images but they are still large which is affecting performance. In future and with customer facing sites i would compress the images more. Test below...

## Deployment

I deployed the site with GitHub pages. I have also researched Netlify for its front end deployment capability. I would use this should GitHub pages be unavailable.

The steps taken to deploy the site were as follows.

1) Update all image file locations to standard formatting. (See Git commit's for reference)
2) Save all files and commit final versions to GitHub repository
3) From GitHub repository, navigate to 'Settings'

![An image of the GitHub settings](assets/testing_imagery/github_settings.png)

4) Scroll down until you find the section 'GitHub Pages'

![An image of the correct GitHub pages settings](assets/testing_imagery/setting_github_pages_view.png)

5) Under 'Source', change branch to 'Master' *this should populate the '/(root)' file. Keep this as is*
6) Hit 'Save'.
7) *Wait a few minutes for the changes to take affect* Now load the prompted URL.

## Credit

The transition css effect (style.css row 70) idea was taken from CSS Tricks - https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/
I got high level guidance for the Gallery's CSS Grid from a youtube tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA&t=16s although my grid layout is different.

**I am available for questions should you have any. Thank you.**
