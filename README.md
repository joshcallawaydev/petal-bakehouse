Below is the README.md file for Petal Bakehouse.

# Overview

Petal Bakehouse is a local bakery business. Within the project I am demonstrating my understanding of HTML5 and CSS3. I used the framework Bootstrap to help structure the site. Roughly 70% of the site is Bootstrap. I also used CCS Grid within the project with Media Queries to further show my understanding of Front-end web development. The site allows users to interact and control eliments with a bootstrap carousel. This was to enhance the sites interactveness and appeal.

##Design

### Color scheme.

### Typography

Inter is the font of choice with Helvetica and Sans-serif as fall back fonts should Inter not be imported into the site properly. Inter is a clear and legible font and according to Typewolf, the most popular choice in 2021.

I chose rem as my sizing metric. I feel this is the best fit in 2021 due to its flexabilty as diff base sizes. I have also used percentages, VH or PX where i felt appropriate

### Imagery

All imagery is imported into Gitpod and was downloaded from Pexels.com. The chosen images were designed to fit the site's niche and catch users attention
